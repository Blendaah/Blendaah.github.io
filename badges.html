        In the Coderclass we get badges instead of grades.
        <br>
        To get one of these you usually have to read and make a few assignments.
        If we do all of those correctly we have to make a bigger project to show we mastered all the skills for that badge.
        <br>
        I personally think this system is way better then the regular school system
